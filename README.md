## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

To be extended, a brief description for now.

An e-commerce/marketplace website for users wanting to buy and sell items. It will allow users to search, filter, and sort for items to purchase, and sellers to create sales listings. Users may add to cart, purchase, or wishlist sales listings, while sellers can edit listings, and view relevant statistics. Time permitting, we may add personal recommendations to users based on user history, email notifications, and additional seller statistics.
